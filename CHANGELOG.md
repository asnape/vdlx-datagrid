# vdlx-datagrid changelog

## v4.6.2

- Export data as CSV: New vdlx-datagrid attributes `show-export` and `export-filename` that display a datagrid header 
  button to allow the user to download the current table contents to a CSV file.

## v4.6.1

- Added debug bundle of the vdlx-datagrid library. This can be used in place of the standard library bundle to facilitate 
  better JavaScript debugging. Although the debug version concatenates the original source it does not minify it so it's easier
  to cross-reference with the original source.

## v4.6.0

Initial release of vdlx-datagrid.

- This version will only work with VDL 4.6 views.
